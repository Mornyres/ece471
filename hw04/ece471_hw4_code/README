ECE 471 Fall 2018 -- Homework 4

Name: Forest LeBlanc


What you did for something cool (if applicable):
	I just made the LED toggle on and off with each press of the button. Originally I planned to do some kind of RTTTL/MIDI thing but quickly decided that would be too complicated and gave up.	
	It occurs to me as I write this that the pushbutton I used is hardware debounced and so I didn't bother with software debouncing. If I were stuck with a single wire or a crappier button, that would have been a good idea.

Answers to Question #5:

a.	usleep() is fairly accurate and will not be optimized out by the compiler, like some busy loops would be.

b.	An OS provides abstraction, reducing complexity associated with the task and allowing it to be performed in more or less the same way across multiple machines running the same OS. 
 
c.	The OS will generally have a set of permissions that will make accessing GPIO more involved -- this is, of course, a good thing if people without permission have access to the device. 

d.	Absolutely not, and I think Microsoft is slimy to claim otherwise. Importantly, this is a matter of principle rather than semantics. Sure, a web browser can actually be ingrained into the OS. But should it? No.
