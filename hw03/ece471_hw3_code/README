Answer to Question #3a:

#1
        add	r10,r10,#10	@ Offset buffer address by 10

#2
	add	r8,r8,#0x30	@ Add 0x30 (which is ASCII 0  here) to the remainder of divide_by_10, which is stored in r8


Describe your something cool:
	I attempted at great length to get STDIN working and tried many suggestions from Stack Exchange, etc. before giving up. So instead I just did descending line numbers.

Answer to Question #7:

a.b.c.

		using `strip` and `ls -lhS`:
		-rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi  632 Sep 23 21:16 hello_world
		-rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi  608 Sep 23 21:16 hello_world.thumb2
		-rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi  604 Sep 23 21:16 hello_world.thumb

		-rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 5.5K Sep 23 21:23 ../../hw02/hello_world

	The C implementation was 5.5KB while the unified ARM executable was 632B. This, clearly, is a huge difference and favors Assembly for space-constrained systems.


d.	The C code was absurdly easier to write. 

Answer to Question #8a:
	
	`man cal | grep 1752 -C 5` reveals that
             "If not specified, ncal ... falls back to September 2,
             1752.  This was when Great Britain and her colonies switched to the
             Gregorian Calendar."
	
	This quirk also (supposedly) inspired Ursula Le Guin's sci-fi novel The Lathe of Heaven.
